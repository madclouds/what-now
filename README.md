## What Now

This is a practice project for me to learn Swift 4, carthage, cocoa pods, Firebase and whatever else I feel like.

I often find myself with time to spare, so I'd like to have an app that I can open and say "I have 15 minutes" and the app will tell me what to work on.

You'll have to add tasks that you want to work on to the list, then when you're done they'll be removed fromt he list.

Some things I need to work on in the near future:

- Add timestamp to tasks
- Sort tasks based on timestamp created (newest up top)
- Update UI to be more card based
